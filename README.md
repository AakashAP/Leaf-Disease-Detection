# Leaf Disease Detection
This Project goal to develop a Deep Learning model with Tensorflow capable to classifying whether a leaf into healthy or diseased categories. I had choosen this project for my machine learning project as my college course.

## Dataset
I used a public Dataset for Training and Testing for the model. The Dataset contains a many images divided into many folders, representing different labels for the model.

## Model Architecture
### Models
The Model I used is Convolutional Network Neural with 8 layers + 1 Data Augmentation layer (6 layers).
